## What is this?
This is a simple project that I was practiced on AWS and Terraform.In this Project I have used terraform to provisition some AWS resources.

## How to deploy this project?
First you need to have Jenkins server, github and docker accounts.In jenkins server, you need to install some recommended plugins and "Pipeline Utility Steps" plugin.If you are using private github repo , you must need to setup credential in jenkins server for pulling source codes.
