## What is this?
This is a simple project that I was practiced on Github(webhook feature),Jenkins (Jenkinsfile,Github hook trigger, groovy language) and  Docker.In this Project I have used the Git/GitHub, Jenkins and Docker and integrated all these technologies to create an automated system for website application.When developer push codes to Github,the Jenkins server will automatically receive trigger from Github and start doing its jobs (build app , build Image and Push Image to Dockerhub).

## How to deploy this project?
First you need to have Jenkins server, github and docker accounts.In jenkins server, you need to install some recommended plugins and "Pipeline Utility Steps" plugin.If you are using private github repo , you must need to setup credential in jenkins server for pulling source codes.
